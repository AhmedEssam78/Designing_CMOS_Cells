# Designing_CMOS_Cells
In this project you will work to design (schematic and layout) and characterize few CMOS (1.8V) standard cells using Electric VLSI software and ngspice. 

Procedure:
Design (layout and schematic), verify and characterize the following cells:
1) Inverter (sizes: 1, 2, 4 and 8)
2) 2 input NAND gate (sizes: 1 and 4) 
3) 2 input NOR gate (sizes: 1 and 4)
4) The complex function: g(x, y, z) = (xy + xz + yz)' (sizes: 1 and 4)
